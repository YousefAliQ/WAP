<!-- Hi Prof,

    I solved this lab in 2 hours, I feel that I refreshed my knowledge in MVC
    and I practised the basics in JSP. I documented the whole code. and I did not
    implement any unit test because I did not change the business module.

    I liked how powerful is MVS works by not changing the module or the business.
    and by splitting the controller from the viewer.

    Thanks,
    yousef

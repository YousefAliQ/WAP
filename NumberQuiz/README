Hi Prof,

I implemented and tested with 100% coverage. The desktop version and business module
designed to be used later by servlets or JSPs.
It took around an hour to solve it.

I implemented the Servlet part in about an hour. I tried to design the best practise of MVC
pattern. nothing challenging except for new things like how to handle sessions in Servlet.

Thanks,
Yousef Ali
